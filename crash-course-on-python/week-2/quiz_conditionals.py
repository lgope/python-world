# Question 2
# Complete the script by filling in the missing parts. The function receives a name, then returns a greeting based on whether or not that name is "Taylor".
def greeting(name):
      if name == "Taylor":
    return "Welcome back Taylor!"
  else:
    return "Hello there, " + name

print(greeting("Taylor"))
print(greeting("John"))

# Question 3
# Whatâ€™s the output of this code if number equals 10?
if number > 11: 
  print(0)
elif number != 10:
  print(1)
elif number >= 20 or number < 12:
  print(2)
else:
  print(3)

# Question 4
# Is "A dog" smaller or larger than "A mouse"? Is 9999+8888 smaller or larger than 100*100? Replace the plus sign in the following code to let Python check it for you and then answer.

print("A dog" < "A mouse" or "A dog" > "A mouse")
print(9999+8888 < 100*100 or 9999+8888 > 100*100)

# Question 5
# If a filesystem has a block size of 4096 bytes, this means that a file comprised of only one byte will still use 4096 bytes of storage. A file made up of 4097 bytes will use 4096*2=8192 bytes of storage. Knowing this, can you fill in the gaps in the calculate_storage function below, which calculates the total number of bytes needed to store a file of a given size?

def calculate_storage(filesize):
    block_size = 4096
    # Use floor division to calculate how many blocks are fully occupied
    full_blocks = block_size / filesize
    # Use the modulo operator to check whether there's any remainder
    partial_block_remainder = block_size % filesize
    # Depending on whether there's a remainder or not, return
    # the total number of bytes required to allocate enough blocks
    # to store your data.
    if partial_block_remainder > 0:
        return block_size * 2
    return block_size

print(calculate_storage(1))    # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4096)) # Should be 4096
print(calculate_storage(4097)) # Should be 8192
print(calculate_storage(6000)) # Should be 8192
